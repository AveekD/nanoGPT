This chapter describes the course EECS 280: Programming and Introductory Data Structures, which covers fundamental concepts in programming, including procedural and data abstraction, resource management, and basic data structures. The course is not just about computers but more about generalizable concepts in programming, such as dynamic resource management, object orientation, and others. The programming language used in the course is C++, which serves as a vehicle to learn these concepts and students will work on several large programming projects to develop their understanding. The chapter also highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between the source code and the program's runtime and provides a basic machine model where memory is represented as a big array with each index corresponding to a memory location. The chapter also introduces several terminologies related to the source code, such as names, variables, scopes, and declarations. At runtime, an object is a piece of data in memory and it has a lifetime, determined by its storage duration. The chapter provides an overview of how objects are created, initialized, modified and destroyed. This chapter sets the stage for the course and provides a glimpse into the topics that will be covered in the course.
